# Options Simulator

This project provides an interactive web application built with Streamlit for comparing different options pricing models under real-world market conditions.

## Project Goal
To analyze options strategies by:
- Pricing an options strategy (Iron Condor, Straddle, or Strangle) using various Binomial Tree models.
- Simulating the underlying asset price using Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM).
- Evaluating the strategy's expected profit and probability of success under both risk-neutral (Q) and real-world (P) measures.
- Optimizing strike prices for maximum expected profit.

## Core Hypothesis
When the real-world stock drift (μ) differs from the risk-free rate (r), different options pricing models (especially those incorporating μ directly) will predict varying levels of actual profitability and optimal strike prices, challenging traditional risk-neutral valuation assumptions.

## Setup and Usage
(Instructions will be added here as the project develops.)
